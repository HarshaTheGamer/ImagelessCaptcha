# Imageless Captcha

Creates a random number on every page load, based on your preferences. From that number, it creates the number as a phrase. In the form, you use the phrase to ask the user to enter it as a number. When the form is posted, you simply check to see if the user's answer matches the number.

* Keeps your form clean, no ugly captcha images or third-party embedded styles
* Extremely lightweight
* Very easy to implement
* Customizable
